# video-codec
In this project, we worked on the compression of grayscale and color videos. In the first phase, we implemented the encoder and decoder. also, we implemented Huffman coding after the Run-Length step. our program can generate a file from the coded video in the encoder unit and convert the coded file to video in the decoder unit.
